# If you're in doubt, check the examples

# How to record

1) don't worry about duplicates: one pacenote can have multiple samples, and I'll use all of them to get a more natural sounding

I think the best way to make it convincing is to record

1 left, 20, 1 right, 30, 2 left, 40, ... (do all corners and distances )

# Absolute minimum samples

## Corners

1 left plus, 1 right plus, 2 left plus, 2 right plus, 3 left plus, 3 right plus, 4 left plus, 4 right plus, 5 left plus, 5 right plus, 6 left plus, 6 right plus
1 left minus, 1 right minus, 2 left minus, 2 right minus, 3 left minus, 3 right minus, 4 left minus, 4 right minus, 5 left minus, 5 right minus, 6 left minus, 6 right minus
1 left, 1 right, 2 left, 2 right, 3 left, 3 right, 4 left, 4 right, 5 left, 5 right, 6 left, 6 right
flat left, flat right
hairpin left, hairpin right
turn left, turn right

### Same, but with "into"
into 1 left plus, etc...

## Distances
10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100
110 120 130 140 150 160 170 180 190
200 250 300 350 400 450 ... until 1000

## Other

I recommend to use these in a real sentence: e.g.

"caution" -> record: caution, hairpin left, keep in, 100
"middle over bump" -> 50, middle over bump, 100
"over crest" -> 3 left, over crest, 120
"tightens" -> into 6 right, tightens
