# Examples

You should always keep in mind some examples. You can watch some onboard rally footage, or try to replicate [this samples here](../art/codrivers/Alex%20Gelsomino/samples), which I sampled from real footage. Obviously, you don't need to do the thick italian accent.

# How to record

The goal is to populate a folder with samples, similar to [this one](../art/codrivers/Alex%20Gelsomino/samples) or [this other one](../art/codrivers/Stu/samples).
Don't worry about making duplicates: one pacenote can have multiple samples, which will go into *samples/alts*. The more samples for one call, the more natural the co-driver will sound.

I think the best way to make it convincing is to record a bunch of combined samples that can be split up later. For exampls, you can record the corner calls by recording

*1 left, 20, 1 right, 30, 2 left, 40, ... (do all corners and distances )*


# Minimal samples

To get a usable co-driver, you need to at least record the following samples:


## Corners

The list of corners to record is

*1 left plus, 1 right plus, 2 left plus, 2 right plus, 3 left plus, 3 right plus, 4 left plus, 4 right plus, 5 left plus, 5 right plus, 6 left plus, 6 right plus 1 left minus, 1 right minus, 2 left minus, 2 right minus, 3 left minus, 3 right minus, 4 left minus, 4 right minus, 5 left minus, 5 right minus, 6 left minus, 6 right minus 1 left, 1 right, 2 left, 2 right, 3 left, 3 right, 4 left, 4 right, 5 left, 5 right, 6 left, 6 right flat left, flat right hairpin left, hairpin right turn left, turn right*


## "Into" corners

Same samples as above, but with "into" before. This makes "into CORNER" less jarring to hear, because no stitching will happen.

*into 1 left plus, 20, into hairpin right, 30, etc...*


## Distances

You are going to need distance calls. You should have recorded some along with the corners, but it's good to have one audio file where you focus on just the numbers, for good measure

*10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 150 160 170 180 190 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 650 700 750 800 850 900 950 1000*

## Other required samples

The following are also required. I recommend to use these in a real sentence: e.g.

* *"caution" -> record: caution, hairpin left, keep in, 100*
* *"middle over bump" -> 50, middle over bump, 100*
* *"over crest" -> 3 left, over crest, 120*
* *"tightens" -> into 6 right, tightens*

*bump, care, caution, crest, cut, dip, dont cut, double caution, down, in, jump, keep in, keep left, keep middle, keep out, keep right, late, left, line, long, middle over bump, middle over crest, middle over jump, minus, narrow, narrows, opens, over bump, over crest, over dip, over jump, plus, right, sharp, short*


# Recommended for a complete co-driver that's compatible with every single rally in the mod

*acute hairpin left, acute hairpin right, acute left, acute right, after crest, and, armco, around bale, around pole, around tree, at crest, at house, at junction, bad camber, barrier outside, big cut, big jump, big jump keep middle, brake, bridge, bumps, bumpy, continues over crest, curb, cut late, cut over crest, deceptive, dont cut late, dont cut long, dont jump, double tightens, downhill, drops, go narrow, go straight, go wide, half long, hole, into acute hairpin left, into acute hairpin right, into bridge, into bump, into crest, into dip, into junction, into mud, jump maybe, junction, long crest, muddy, narrow bridge, narrows, onto bridge, onto dirt, onto gravel, onto narrow bridge, onto tarmac, open hairpin left, open hairpin right, opens long, opens over crest, opens very long, over bridge, over kink, over small jump, plus short, rocks in road, rocks inside, rocks outside, round, sharp over crest, slight left, slight right, slippy, slowing, small crest, small cut, small jump, square left, square right, tarmac, then, through narrow gate, through tunnel, through water splash, tidy, tight, tight hairpin left, tight hairpin right, tightens, to hairpin, to 1, to 2, to 3, to 4, to 5, to 6, to finish, triple caution, tunnel 4 left, twisty, up, uphill, very late, very long, wide out*
