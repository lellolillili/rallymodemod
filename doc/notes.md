# Urgent

* Some calls don't work for the RBR codrivers (there's a few examples in small island)
* Also need to test Alex Gelsomino in the above.

* No mesh in small island rally


# Time trials:

Johnson valley loop - test & add clutter
Johnson SSS - do pacenotes 

Shakedown: Jungle Rock Island - Fucked 
Shakedown: San Toltego - Fucked 

Shakedown: Norte-Portino - Fucked (should work now)

# General

* After you have "at junction" change all the "junction acute/1/2/3 l/r" into "acute/1/2/3 at junction".

# Changelog 
* Added multilanguage support

========================================

# TODO: Next release

* The symbols only show if you pause and unpause physics, at least in the
  experimental version

* merge the distance call into the actual call, so you can use phrases with
  distances in them, e.g., 30 right, continues over 30, etc
* "options" field
  1. timing adjustments
  2. repeat option: repeats the pacenote
* Double check the positioning of all pacenotes. Sometimes you put waypoints in the middle of a corner, which is wrong.
* Rally start with nicer countdown and possibility of a jump-start. Look at dragrace.lua. There's an implementation of jump start detection there.

========================================
# Samples

# Alex Gelsomino

* "right.ogg" is missing.
* consider creating "keep left", "keep right", "keep middle", "keep out", "keep in".
