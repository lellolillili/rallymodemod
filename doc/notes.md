# Time trials:

Johnson valley loop - test & add clutter
Johnson SSS - do pacenotes 

Shakedown: Jungle Rock Island - Fucked 
Shakedown: San Toltego - Fucked 

Shakedown: Norte-Portino - Fucked (should work now)

# General

* After you have "at junction" change all the "junction acute/1/2/3 l/r" into "acute/1/2/3 at junction".
* Merge the distance call into the actual call, so you can use phrases with distances in them, e.g., 30 right, continues over 30, etc
* "options" field
  1. timing adjustments
  2. repeat option: repeats the pacenote
* Double check the positioning of all pacenotes. Sometimes you put waypoints in the middle of a corner, which is wrong.
* Rally start with nicer countdown and possibility of a jump-start. Look at dragrace.lua. There's an implementation of jump start detection there.

## Stu

* I think "5 left tightens is weird"
* The new samples sound different (i think it's the sample rate)
