# Samples
# =======

# Here we associate a symbol to each sample It is not necessary to specify a
# substitution if it's obvious.  Obvious mean that there exists a picture file
# whose filename is the same as the sample filename.
#
# Example:
# The codriver has the sample 100.ogg and the symbols folder has the file
# 100.svg.  The picture 100.svg will be shown in the UI whenever the sample
# 100.ogg is used.

# If a sample exists, but there is no symbol for it, you can either ignore it,
# or choose the best match.
#
# Example:
# There is no symbol for "ice", but there is a symbol for "slippy". We specify
# this association as
# ice >>> slippy

# If a sample should use more than one symbol, we need to specify all the
# symbols explicitly, separated by a comma.

# Example:
# and 2 left plus >>> into, 2 left, plus
# will use the 3 sympbols: into.svg 2 left.svg, and plus.svg
