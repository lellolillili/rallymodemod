# Corners
# =======

# Here you associate corner codes to specific samples. We do this so we can have
# different co-drivers use different samples and/or conventions without having
# to change pacenotes. If you hate corner codes, you can still make your own
# pacenotes using the regular sample names (e.g., "hairpin left", "3 right"),
# but they're not going to be compatible with multiple codrivers. Best of both
# worlds is you write the pacenotes however you like, and then run a
# find-and-replace whenever you're done.

# Example:
# With default Stu
#   L0E: will play Stu's "hairpin left.ogg" sample
#   RS will play "square right"
#   L6P will play "flat left"

# With default Alex Gelsomino
#   L0E will play Alex Gelsomino's "left 1.ogg" sample
#   RS will play "turn right 2"
#   L6P will play "6 right plus"

# You can play around with these, and make your own conventions, as long as
# there is a sample (either see the list below, or inspect samples folders
# directly). The default convention for Stu (the default codriver) is the
# Dirt:Rally one (because it's the most popular rally game).

# If you want to have visual pacenotes working properly, keep in mind that any
# convention other than the defult one will require you to update the
# symbols.ini file. This is easy, check out "symbols.ini".  I'm not bothering
# making this more flexible/automated because if you're going to use your own
# corner convention I'm assuming you're an expert and you have disabled the
# visual pacenotes anyway.

# Example:

# R0M(inus): "acute right" in Dirt:Rally
# R0E(xact): "hairpin right" in Dirt:Rally
# R0P(lus): faster than a hairpin right in Dirt:Rally, but slower than a "1 right"

# L2M(minus): slower than a L3E
# L3E(xact): same as a "3 left" in Dirt Rally 1 or 2.
# L4P(lus): faster than a L3E

# etc.

# Example:
# Stu has samples that allow you do use the 1 to 12 convention, so you can do
# something similar to what Elfyn Evans uses.

# S - square LR
#
# 0M - 1 LR
# 0E - hairpin LR
# 0P - open hairpin LR
#
# 1M - 12 LR minus
# 1E - 11 LR
# 1P - 10 LR plus
#
# 2M - 9 LR minus
# 2E - 8 LR
# 2P - 7 LR plus
#
# 3M - 6 LR minus
# 3E - 6 LR
# 3P - 5 LR
#
# 4M - 5 LR plus
# 4E - 4 LR
# 4P - 4 LR plus
#
# 5M - 3 LR minus
# 5E - 3 LR
# 5P - 2 LR minus
#
# 6M - 2 LR
# 6E - 1 LR minus
# 6P - 1 LR

# ============
# Slow corners
# ============
#
# The codriver will search these keywords in the pacenotes, and if it finds a
# match, it will treat the corners as a slow corner. A slow corner is a corner
# that takes a while to clear. When clearing a slow corner, the codriver will
# take a breath before calling the distance to the subsequent corner, since
# there is no rush to call the distance. Remove them if you dislike this
# behavior.

# Example:
# The next two corners is a left hairpin, and after 100 meters we have a 6
# right. Stu will say
# "hairpin left" ...
# wait until you are in the middle of the hairpin, and say
# ... "100"
# wait until appropriate
# "6 right" etc

# ============
# Replacements
# ============

# Instead of messing with filenames and stuff, you can specify replacements here as, for example
# For corners, use corner codes instead of this method.

# from >>> to

# Whenever you encounter "from" in the pacenotes, they codriver will say "to" instead.

# care >>> watch
# dont cut >>> dont
# keep in >>> in
# ice >>> icy
long long >>> very long
jump >>> into jump
